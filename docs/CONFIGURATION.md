# Configuration reference

Everything the bridge reads: `bridge/config.json`, command-line flags, environment variables, and the files it writes next to itself. `node setup.js` writes a working `config.json` from `bridge/config.example.json` (and brings an older one up to date); this page explains each key so you can tune it by hand.

The bridge reads `config.json` once at start. Restart it after editing, except for an agent's `allowedTools`, which the **Allow & retry** button updates live.

## Paths

| Key | Default (from `config.example.json`) | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `addonDir` | `…\World of Warcraft\_classic_beta_\Interface\AddOns` | The game's AddOns folder. The bridge writes the slot addons, `Inbox.lua` and every signal file under it. `setup.js` fills this in from the client it finds. |
| `inboxFile` | `<addonDir>\WoWAI\Inbox.lua` | The file the game reads on `/reload` (fallback path). Normally derived from `addonDir`; only change it if you moved the addon. A value still naming the old `WoWClaude` addon is ignored in favour of the derived one. |
| `savedVariablesFile` | `…\WTF\Account\<account>\SavedVariables\WoWAI.lua` | The addon's saved data. The bridge polls it for the reload-path outbox. `setup.js` picks the first account under `WTF\Account`; pass `--account <name>` to choose another. |
| `defaultCwd` | `C:\path\to\your\project` | Folder for chats that have not chosen one with `/wow-ai cd`, when the bridge is started from inside this repo (`npm start`). See [Which folder the agent works in](#which-folder-the-agent-works-in). |

## Agents

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `agent` | `"claude"` | The agent for chats that have not picked one with `/wow-ai agent`. One of `claude`, `codex`, `grok`; the bridge refuses to start on anything else. |
| `agents.<id>` | one block per agent | That agent's settings, below. A missing block means the defaults. |

Keys under `agents.claude`, `agents.codex` and `agents.grok` (what each one means per agent is spelled out in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)):

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `permissionMode` | `"acceptEdits"` | `acceptEdits` auto-approves file edits inside the working folder; `bypassPermissions` approves everything; `default` approves nothing beyond what `allowedTools` names. Claude gets it as `--permission-mode`; for Codex it picks the sandbox (`read-only` / `workspace-write` / none); for Grok it becomes `--permission-mode dontAsk` plus allow rules, or `--always-approve` (headless Grok runs ordinary commands on its own and blocks dangerous ones unless a rule allows them; see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)). |
| `allowedTools` | git, npm, npx, node, python, pip, pytest, ls, dir, WebSearch, WebFetch | Rules in Claude Code's syntax: `Bash(git:*)` allows any command starting with `git`, `WebSearch` a tool. Passed to Claude as `--allowedTools`, translated to Grok's `--allow` globs, ignored by Codex. The **Allow & retry** button in game appends rules here permanently. |
| `deniedTools` | `[]` | Rules the agent may never use, same syntax. Claude: `--disallowedTools`; Grok: `--deny`, which wins over everything, `bypassPermissions` included; ignored by Codex. |
| `model` | `""` | Passed to the CLI (`--model` / `-m`) when non-empty. Empty uses the CLI's default. |
| `path` | `""` | Full path to the executable. Empty means: look in the installer's folder, then `PATH`, then npm's launcher. A `.js` path is run with the bridge's Node. |
| `extraArgs` | `[]` | More command-line arguments, added verbatim (before Codex's `resume` subcommand). |
| `networkAccess` (codex only) | `false` | `true` lets commands inside Codex's `workspace-write` sandbox reach the network (`-c sandbox_workspace_write.network_access=true`). |

A `config.json` from before agents existed kept Claude's settings at the top level (`claudePath`, `model`, `permissionMode`, `allowedTools`). The bridge still reads them, under anything in `agents.claude`; `setup.js` moves them down.

## Runs

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `gameContext` | `true` | Put the character/zone context the addon sends into the agent's system prompt. `false` ignores it, for a bridge only ever used on unrelated projects. The addon has its own switch, `/wow-ai context off`, which also clears what the bridge holds. |
| `primerFile` | `"docs/WOW-ADDON-PRIMER.md"` | A markdown file appended to the system prompt together with the game context, whatever folder the chat works in: how to write addons and macros for this client. Relative to the wow-ai folder, or absolute. Re-read on every run, so edits count at once. `""` sends none. Off whenever the context is off. |
| `maxParallel` | `3` | How many chats may run an agent at the same time. Further messages queue per chat. |
| `timeoutMs` | `1800000` (30 min) | A run longer than this is killed (with its children) and reported as an error in game. |
| `progressWriteMs` | `3000` | Minimum gap between progress writes to the slot files. Final replies are written immediately. |
| `pollMs` | `750` | How often the bridge checks the SavedVariables file for a reload-path message. |

## Screen capture

Keys under `capture`:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | Run `capture.ps1`. With `false` only the reload path works (`/wow-ai mode reload` in game). |
| `processName` | `"WowB"` | The game executable without `.exe`. `setup.js` sets it from the `Wow*.exe` it finds in the client folder. |
| `cellPx` | `4` | Pixel size of one strip cell. Must match `CELL` in `addon/WoWAI/Codec.lua`. |
| `cellsPerRow` | `200` | Cells per strip row. Must match the addon. |
| `maxRows` | `48` | Maximum strip rows captured. Must match the addon. |
| `intervalMs` | `250` | Capture period. Lower is more responsive and costs a little more CPU. |

The capture region is `cellsPerRow × cellPx` by `maxRows × cellPx` pixels (800 × 192 by default) at the top-left of the game's client area.

## Slot pool and signal files

These sizes are baked into the files `install-slots.js` creates, and the addon has matching constants at the top of `addon/WoWAI/WoWAI.lua` (`SLOT_COUNT`, `ACT_MAX`, `PRESENCE_MAX`). Change all three places together, re-run `node bridge/install-slots.js`, and restart the game.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `slots` | `200` | Reply-slot addons `WoWAI_S001` … `WoWAI_S200`. Each slot can be loaded once per UI session; `/reload` frees them all. |
| `actMax` | `60` | Heartbeat files per message (`act/NNN/01..60.wav`). One flips per agent action. |
| `presenceMax` | `2000` | Presence files (`presence/0001..2000.wav`). One flips per `presenceIntervalMs`. |
| `presenceIntervalMs` | `30000` | How often the bridge flips a presence file so the in-game light stays green. |
| `tocInterface` | `"16001"` | `## Interface:` version written into every slot addon's `.toc`. Bump it when the client's TOC version changes. |

## Command line

`wow-ai` (after `npm link`) and `node bridge/bridge.js` take the same flags. `npm start` runs `bridge/supervisor.js`, which restarts the bridge on crash and passes flags through.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--project <dir>` | Default working folder for this run. Overrides everything else. |
| `--once` | Handle one pending reload-path message and exit. |
| `--inject "<text>"` | Pretend the strip said this, run the agent, publish the result, exit. Handy for checking a setup without the game. |
| `--agent <id>` | Which agent `--inject` uses (default: `agent` from the config). |
| `--help`, `-h` | Print usage. |

Exit codes: `0` normal, `1` the injected or one-shot job failed, `2` config missing, unreadable or naming an unknown agent. The supervisor only restarts on codes other than `0` and `2`.

## Environment

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `WOW_AI_PROJECT` | Default working folder, below `--project` and above the start folder in precedence. |
| `CLAUDECODE` | Removed from Claude's environment so a bridge started from inside a Claude Code session can still launch `claude -p`. |
| `GROK_DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` | Set to `1` for Grok runs, so a headless run never stops for an update. |
| `GROK_HOME` | Honoured when looking for `grok.exe` (`<GROK_HOME>\bin`); Grok's own setting. |

## Which folder the agent works in

Each chat can pick its own folder with `/wow-ai cd` or **Folder...** in the menu that opens when you right-click the chat in the left panel. Chats that have not are given the bridge's default folder, chosen in this order:

1. `--project <dir>`
2. `WOW_AI_PROJECT`
3. The folder the bridge was started from, unless that is inside this repo
4. `defaultCwd` in `config.json`
5. The current folder

A relative `/wow-ai cd` path is resolved against that default. `~` expands to your home folder. The agents keep sessions per folder, so a chat that changes folder starts a fresh session there; the same happens when a chat changes agent.

## Files the bridge writes next to itself

All of these are gitignored.

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `bridge/config.json` | Your configuration. |
| `bridge/state.json` | Agent session ids per chat, the folder and the agent each session ran with, handled message ids per addon session token, the presence counter, and the latest game context the addon sent (`context`). Delete it to forget all sessions. |
| `bridge/transcripts.json` | The last 200 messages of every chat, with the agent that wrote each reply, so the addon can recover its chats after the client wipes saved data. |
| `bridge/bridge.log` | Everything printed to the console, with timestamps. Grows without bound; delete it whenever you like. |
| `bridge/tmp/` | Prompt files for agents that read the prompt from disk (Grok). Each is deleted when its run ends. |

## `setup.js` flags

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--wow "<client folder>"` | The folder containing `Wow*.exe` and `Interface\`, when auto-detection fails. |
| `--project "<dir>"` | Written to `defaultCwd`. Defaults to the folder you ran setup from. |
| `--account <name>` | Which `WTF\Account\<name>` to use when there are several. |

Re-running `setup.js` re-copies the addon (except `Inbox.lua`, which the bridge owns once running), keeps an existing `config.json` (adding the `agents` blocks and fixing paths if it predates them), and only creates slot and signal files that are missing. An install under the project's old name (the `WoWClaude` addon) is migrated: its saved data is copied to `WoWAI.lua` so chats survive, and the old addon and slot folders are removed.
